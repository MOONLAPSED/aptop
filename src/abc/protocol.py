class BaseContextManager(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for custom context managers.

    This class defines the required methods for creating a custom context manager
    that can be used with the `with` statement in Python. Subclasses must implement
    the `__enter__`, `__exit__`, and `_root` methods.

    The `__enter__` method is called when the context manager is entered (i.e., when
    the `with` statement is executed). It should return the object that will be bound
    to the target variable in the `with` statement (or `None` if no target variable
    is specified).

    The `__exit__` method is called when the context manager is exited, either
    normally or due to an exception. It takes three arguments:
    - `exc_type`: The exception type (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`, etc.) that was
      raised, or `None` if no exception occurred.
    - `exc_value`: The instance of the exception that was raised, or `None` if no
      exception occurred.
    - `traceback`: A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point
      where the exception was raised, or `None` if no exception occurred.

    The `__exit__` method can handle the exception by returning `True` (in which case
    the exception is suppressed and execution continues), or it can return `False`
    (in which case the exception is propagated up the call stack).

    The `_root` method is a placeholder for any additional functionality that should
    be implemented by subclasses.

class BaseProtocol(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for defining communication protocols.

    This class serves as a blueprint for creating concrete protocol implementations
    that handle data encoding, transmission, and decoding. Subclasses must implement
    the `encode`, `transmit`, and `decode` methods.

    The `encode` method is responsible for converting data into a format suitable
    for transmission over a specific communication channel. It should take the raw
    data as input and return an encoded representation of that data.

    The `transmit` method is responsible for sending the encoded data over the
    communication channel. It should take the encoded data as input and handle the
    actual transmission process, which may involve establishing a connection,
    sending the data, and closing the connection.

    The `decode` method is responsible for converting the received encoded data
    back into its original format. It should take the encoded data as input and
    return the decoded, original data.

    Subclasses may also need to implement additional methods or properties to
    configure the protocol settings, such as specifying the communication channel,
    encoding/decoding algorithms, or any other protocol-specific parameters.

    The method should return the output or result of the executed task or process.
